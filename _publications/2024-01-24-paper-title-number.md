Abstract: mid-infrared spectroscopy is often used to identify material. Thousands of spectral points are measured in a time-consuming process using expensive table-top instrument. However, material identification is a sparse problem, which in theory can be solved with just a few measurements. Here the sparsity of the problem is exploited to develop an ultra-fast, portable, and inexpensive method to identify materials. In a single-shot, a mid-infrared camera can identify materials based on their spectroscopic signatures. This method does not require prior calibration, making it robust and versatile in handling a broad range of materials.
