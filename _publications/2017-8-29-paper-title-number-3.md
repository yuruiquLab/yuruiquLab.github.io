Abstract: dynamic thermal emission control has attracted growing interest in a broad range of fields, including radiative cooling, thermophotovoltaics and adaptive camouflage. Previous demonstrations of dynamic thermal emission control present disadvantages of either large thickness or requiring sustained electrical or thermal excitations. In this paper, an ultrathin (∼0.023λ, λ is the emission peak wavelength) metal-insulator-metal plasmonic metamaterial-based zero-static-power mid-infrared thermal emitter incorporating phase-changing material GST is experimentally demonstrated to dynamically control the thermal emission. The electromagnetic modes can be continuously tuned through the intermediate phases determined by controlling the temperature. A typical resonance mode, which involves the coupling between the high-order magnetic resonance and anti-reflection resonance, shifts from 6.51 to 9.33 μm while GST is tuned from amorphous to crystalline phase. This demonstration will pave the way towards the dynamical thermal emission control in both the fundamental science field and a number of energy-harvesting applications.
